### Description

This is a simple game built while doddling with a couple of recent uploads; Ryan Spencer's 'A "Button" Form' txtCodeId=61380 and aditya8000's 'Visible Light Spectrum' txtCodeId=61446. Instead dozens of hand laid buttons this code uses a runtime generated array of buttons and an abstraction of aditya8000's code to detect and draw some colours. The Spectrum drawing routine (mine not aditya's) is not quite right and a black edge may appear at some form sizes, however the colour to wavelength and wavelength to colour routines work well.

Have fun.
